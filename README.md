# Agentic Backlog Generator - Stepwise Refinement

An agentic AI product backlog generator in six progressive versions. Each version introduces one new pattern, building on the previous, until the system is fully autonomous.

---

## What This Project Does

Given a plain-English product requirement, the system generates:
- **1 Epic** with business-level acceptance criteria
- **3 Features** derived from the Epic, each with acceptance criteria

The requirement is passed via the command line:

```bash
python backlog_gen_v6.py "Grandma has a car and wants to know when she should refill fuel"
```

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running locally

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install ollama
ollama pull gemma3:1b
ollama pull qwen3-coder:480b-cloud
```

> **Note on models:** v1, v2, and v3 use `gemma3:1b` for simplicity. v4 onwards use `qwen3-coder:480b-cloud` for better instruction-following. If you want to use a different model, change the `MODEL` constant at the top of each file. `mistral` and `llama3.2:3b` are good alternatives.

## The Six Versions

| Version | Pattern | What's Introduced |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| [v1-pipeline](v1-pipeline/Readme.md) | Sequential Pipeline | `ask_llm()`, prompt templates, LLM chaining |
| [v2-shared-state](v2-shared-state/Readme.md) | Shared State | Single `state` dict passed through all functions |
| [v3-planner-agent](v3-planner-agent/Readme.md) | Planner Agent | LLM decides which steps to run at runtime |
| [v4-critic-loop](v4-critic-loop/Readme.md) | Critic Loop | Per-artifact critique and revision cycle |
| [v5-multi-agent](v5-multi-agent/Readme.md) | Multi-Agent | Self-contained agent classes, Coordinator |
| [v6-autonomous](v6-autonomous/Readme.md) | Autonomous | Global critic, LLM-driven routing, selective re-execution |

---

## Suggested Learning Path

Run each version with the **same requirement** so you can compare how the output and the console behavior evolve:

```bash
python backlog_gen_v1.py "Grandma has a car and wants to know when she should refill fuel"
python backlog_gen_v2.py "Grandma has a car and wants to know when she should refill fuel"
python backlog_gen_v3.py "Grandma has a car and wants to know when she should refill fuel"
python backlog_gen_v4.py "Grandma has a car and wants to know when she should refill fuel"
python backlog_gen_v5.py "Grandma has a car and wants to know when she should refill fuel"
python backlog_gen_v6.py "Grandma has a car and wants to know when she should refill fuel"
```

---

## What to Observe at Each Version

**v1-pipeline**
The output appears immediately with no intermediate steps visible. Notice how bare it is - no planning, no checking, no structure.

**v2-shared-state**
The output looks the same as v1, but the code is fundamentally different. Study how `state` flows through the functions. This is the scaffolding everything else is built on.

**v3-planner-agent**
Watch for the `Planning workflow...` and `Confirmed Plan:` lines. The LLM is now deciding what to do before doing it.

**v4-critic-loop**
This is where the console gets interesting. Watch the `--- Critic Input ---` block to see exactly what the critic receives. Notice whether it approves immediately or requests revisions. Try a vague requirement to force revisions.

**v5-multi-agent**
Watch for the `[EpicAgent] Starting...` and `[FeaturesAgent] Starting...` labels. The agents are now self-contained units. Notice that the Planner is still driving the sequence - the Coordinator doesn't hardcode what to run.

**v6-autonomous**
Watch for the `[Global Critic] Verdict:` line after both agents complete. This is the system evaluating its own output holistically. If it returns `REDO: features`, watch the FeaturesAgent re-run while the Epic is preserved. This is selective re-execution in action.

## Key Agentic Patterns Covered

| Pattern | First appears in |
|---------|-----------------|
| LLM chaining | v1 |
| Shared state | v2 |
| LLM-driven control flow | v3 |
| Self-correction (critic loop) | v4 |
| Multi-agent encapsulation | v5 |
| Holistic quality review | v6 |
| LLM-driven routing | v6 |
| Selective re-execution | v6 |

## Real-World Parallels

| This project | Real-world equivalent |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Planner | Router / Supervisor in LangGraph |
| Shared state | AgentState in LangGraph |
| Critic loop | Reflection pattern in LangChain |
| Coordinator | Orchestrator in AutoGen / CrewAI |
| Global critic + routing | Conditional edges in LangGraph |
